# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Task
The assignment was to create a random password generator. I tried doing what I could but I'm not at the point where I can do this assignment confidently despite 3 days of studying and trying to understand. So in my script.js you'll see fragments of what's supposed to be the entire thing, and some of them are probably right, but I'm having trouble tying it all together and brigning it to a logical conclusion. My apologies for submitting an imcomplete work.
